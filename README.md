### Introduction to the Project 


### Data
The data for the task of Dog-Cat image classification can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EdVqRCT1NSYT6Ge-SvAIu7R5i9Og2tiO?usp=sharing. The dataset has been divided into three sets: Training data, Validation data and Testing data. The analysis of different CNN architectures for Dog-Cat image classification was done on comparing the Training Accuracy and Validation Accuracy values.


### Results



### Software Required
To run the jupyter notebooks, use Python 3. Standard libraries like Numpy and PyTorch are used.
